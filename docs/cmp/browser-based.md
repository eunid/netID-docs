### netID Identifier

If the `origin` is eligible, a publisher (TAPP) can access the userâ€™s identifier (`tpid`) via the following interface:

#### Request

```http
GET https://einwilligungsspeicher.netid.de/netid-subject-identifiers?q.tapp_id.eq=<TAPP_ID> HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/vnd.netid.permission-center.netid-tpid-subject-v1+json
Cookie: tpid_sec=<JWT_TOKEN>
Origin: <ORIGIN>
```

#### Response

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/vnd.netid.permission-center.netid-tpid-subject-v1+json
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: <ORIGIN>
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true

{
  "tpid": "<TPID>"
  "status_code": "OK"
}
```

#### Response properties 

`tpid` - users netID identifier. Only returned if consent "identification" is given, the `tpid` is known (i.e. user is already authenticated on the device) and status "OK". Otherwise null.

| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| OK | Call successful | x |

## Write API

### Write privacy status

#### Request

```http
POST https://einwilligen.netid.de/netid-permissions?q.tapp_id.eq=<TAPP_ID> HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/vnd.netid.permission-center.netid-permissions-v1+json
Accept: application/vnd.netid.permission-center.netid-tpid-subject-status-v1+json
Cookie: tpid_sec=<JWT_TOKEN>
Origin: <ORIGIN>

{
  "identification": "true|false",
  "tc": "<TC string>"
}
```

#### Response

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: https://einwilligungsspeicher.netid.de/netid-permissions?q.tapp_id.eq=<TAPP_ID>
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: <ORIGIN>
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true

{
  "tpid": "<TPID>|null",
  "status_code": "OK"
}
```

!!! info "Remarks"
    - There must be at least one permission ("identification", "tc"). Permissions are optional. If a permission should not be written, the JSON property is missing. 
    - If consent for "identification" has been given by the user, this must be signaled by passing "identification: true". For the avoidance of doubt, this of course requires the prior collection of this consent by the CMP.
    - If only the TC string is to be updated and the consent for "identification" already exists, only the "tc" attribute can be passed. All two can also be written at the same time.
    - In case of revocation the consent for "identification", "identification: false" is passed.
<br>
#### Request properties

|item|description|
|---|---|
| identification | Boolean flag, indicating the status of the consent "identification". <br> *true* = Consent is given <br> *false* = consent is not given or revoked |
| tc | TC String which should be stored/updated for this user in relation to the netID Partner (TCF 2.0) |
<br>
