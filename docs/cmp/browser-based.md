# Browser-based API (Client-Side Integration)

Description of the browser-based integration by the CMP.

## API flow examples

### Obtaining a privacy status

The following sequence illustrates the API calls initiated by a netID Partners CMP to establish a privacy status for an already authenticated user.

### netID Identifier

If the `origin` is eligible, a publisher (TAPP) can access the userâ€™s identifier (`tpid`) via the following interface:

=== "Query"

    ``` shell
    GET https://einwilligungsspeicher.netid.de/netid-subject-identifiers?q.tapp_id.eq=<TAPP_ID>
    Accept: application/vnd.netid.permission-center.netid-tpid-subject-v1+json
    Cookie: tpid_sec=<JWT_TOKEN>
    Origin: <ORIGIN>
    ```

=== "Response"

    ``` shell
    200 OK
    Content-Type: application/vnd.netid.permission-center.netid-tpid-subject-v1+json
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: <ORIGIN>
    Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true

    {
      "tpid": "<TPID>"
      "status_code": "OK"
    }
    ```

#### Response properties

`tpid` - Users netID Identifier. Only returned if consent "identification" is given, the `tpid` is known (i.e. user is already authenticated on the device) and status "OK". Otherwise null.

| status_code | meaning | tpid |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| OK | Call successful | x |
| NO_TPID | There was no tpid_sec cookie available. | - |
| TPID_NOT_FOUND | No Permissions found for `tpid`. | - |
| TPID_EXISTENCE_ERROR | `tpid` ("identification") does not exist any more: 'NO_DETAILS', 'DELETED', 'MIGRATED' | - |
| ID_CONSENT_REQUIRED | Consent for passing the `tpid` ("identification") was not given or was revoked by the user | - |

#### Response behavior

| HTTP status code | meaning |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 200 OK | - `tpid` of the netID user returned |
| 400 BAD REQUEST | - Parameters are missing. Parameter '<name>' is missing. |
| 403 FORBIDDEN | - Business rule preconditions are violated. No IDConsent permission ("identification") given to return the `tpid` |
| 404 NOT FOUND | - Permissions for `tpid` not found. |
| 410 GONE | - `tpid` does not exist any more: 'NO_DETAILS', 'DELETED', 'MIGRATED' |

### Read privacy status

=== "Query"

    ``` shell
    GET https://einwilligungsspeicher.netid.de/permissions/iab-permissions?
        tapp_id=<TAPP_ID>
    Accept: application/vnd.netid.permissions.iab-permissions-read-v1+json
    Cookie: tpid_sec=<JWT_TOKEN>
    Origin: <ORIGIN>
    ```

=== "Response"

    ``` shell
    200 OK
    Content-Type: application/vnd.netid.permissions.iab-permissions-read-v1+json
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: <ORIGIN>
    Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true

    {
      "tpid": "<TPID>|null",
      "tc": "<TC string>|null",
      "status": "OK|NO_TPID|TOKEN_ERROR|CONSENT_REQUIRED"
    }
    ```

#### Response Properties

| item |description|
|---|---|
| tpid | Users identifier (`tpid`). Only returned if consent "identification" is given, the `tpid` is known (i.e. user is already authenticated on the device) and status "OK". Otherwise null |
| tc | TC string stored for this `tpid` for this respective netID Partner (TAPP). Only with status "OK". Otherwise null |

| status | meaning | tc | tpid |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |

| NO_TPID | There was no tpid_sec cookie available. | - | - |
| TOKEN_ERROR | Token (JWT) in the tpid_sec cookie is expired or invalid. | - | - |
| CONSENT_REQUIRED | Consent for passing the `tpid` ("identification") was revoked or declined by the user | x | - |

#### Response behavior

| status code | meaning |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 200 OK | - `tpid` of the netID user is returned, if consent of "identification" is given <br> - TC String is returned if present|
| 400 BAD REQUEST | - missing authentication/no tpid_sec cookie available <br> - provided token (JWT) in the tpid_sec cookie is expired or invalid |
| 403 FORBIDDEN | - missing parameters (`tapp_id`, `origin`) <br> - requesting TAPP isn't active |
| 404 NOT FOUND | - `tpid` in tpid_sec cookie does not exist <br> - consent for "identification" is not granted and TC String is not available <br> - TC String is not available |

## Write API

### Write privacy status

=== "Query"

    ``` shell
    POST https://einwilligen.netid.de/permissions/iab-permissions?
      tapp_id=<TAPP_ID>
    Content-Type: application/vnd.netid.permissions.iab-permission-write-v1+json
    Cookie: tpid_sec=<JWT_TOKEN>
    Origin: <ORIGIN>

    {
      "identification": "true|false",
      "tc": "<TC string>"
    }
    ```

=== "Response"

    ``` shell
    201 CREATED
    Location: https://einwilligungsspeicher.netid.de/permissions/iab-permissions?
      tapp_id=<TAPP_ID>
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: <ORIGIN>
    Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true

    {
      "tpid": "<TPID>|null",
      "status": "OK|NO_TPID|TOKEN_ERROR"
    }
    ```

!!! info "Remarks"
    - If consent for "identification" has been given by the user, this must be signaled by passing "identification: true". For the avoidance of doubt, this of course requires the prior collection of this consent by the CMP.
    - If only the TC string is to be updated and the consent for "identification" already exists, only the "tc" attribute can be passed. Both can also be written at the same time.
    - In case of revocation the consent for "identification", only "identification: false" is passed.

#### Request properties

|item|description|
|---|---|
| identification | Boolean flag, indicating the status of the consent "identification". <br> *true* = Consent is given <br> *false* = consent is not given or revoked |
| tc | TC String which should be stored for this user in relation to the netID Partner (TCF 2.0) |

#### Response properties

`tpid` - Users netID Identifier. Only present if consent "Identification" is given, the `tpid` is known and status is "OK". Otherwise null.

| status | meaning |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| OK | TC String/consent for "identification" was stored. |
| NO_TPID | There was no `tpid_sec` cookie available. |
| TOKEN_ERROR | Token (JWT) in the cookie has expired or is invalid. |

#### Response behavior

| status code | meaning |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 201 CREATED | Call successful |
| 400 BAD REQUEST | - missing authentication/no tpid_sec cookie available <br> - provided token (JWT) in the tpid_sec cookie is expired or invalid|
| 403 FORBIDDEN | - missing parameters (`tapp_id`, `origin`) <br> - requesting TAPP isn't active |
| 410 GONE | `tpid` in tpid_sec cookie isn't active |
