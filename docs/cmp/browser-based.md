Description of the browser-based integration by the CMP.

## API flow examples

### netID Identifier

If the `origin` is eligible, a publisher (TAPP) can access the userâ€™s identifier (`tpid`) via the following interface:

=== "Query"

    ``` shell
    GET https://einwilligungsspeicher.netid.de/netid-subject-identifiers?q.tapp_id.eq=<TAPP_ID>
    Accept: application/vnd.netid.permission-center.netid-tpid-subject-v1+json
    Cookie: tpid_sec=<JWT_TOKEN>
    Origin: <ORIGIN>
    ```

=== "Response"

    ``` shell
    200 OK
    Content-Type: application/vnd.netid.permission-center.netid-tpid-subject-v1+json
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: <ORIGIN>
    Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true

    {
      "tpid": "<TPID>"
      "status_code": "OK"
    }
    ```

#### Response properties

`tpid` - Users netID Identifier. Only returned if consent "identification" is given, the `tpid` is known (i.e. user is already authenticated on the device) and status "OK". Otherwise null.

| status_code | meaning | tpid |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| OK | Call successful | x |
| NO_TPID | No `tpid` in request available. Parameter 'name' is missing. | - |
| NO_TAPP_ID | No `TAPP_ID` in request available. Parameter 'name' is missing. | - |
| PERMISSIONS_NOT_FOUND | Permissions for `tpid` not found. | - |
| TPID_EXISTENCE_ERROR | `tpid` ("identification") does not exist any more: 'NO_DETAILS', 'DELETED', 'MIGRATED' | - |
| ID_CONSENT_REQUIRED | Consent for passing the `tpid` ("identification") was not given or was revoked by the user | - |

#### Response behavior

| HTTP status code | meaning |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 200 OK | - `tpid` of the netID user returned, if consent is given. <TCSTRING> is transfered if available. Value of consent for "datashare" is transfered. |
| 400 BAD REQUEST | - Parameters are missing. Parameter 'name' is missing. |
| 404 NOT FOUND | - Permissions for `tpid` not found. |
| 410 GONE | - `tpid` does not exist any more: 'NO_DETAILS', 'DELETED', 'MIGRATED' |

### Read privacy status

      "datashare": "VALID"|"INVALID"|null,
      "status_code": "OK"|"ID_CONSENT_REQUIRED"
    }
    ```

#### Response Properties

## Write API

### Write privacy status

=== "Query"

    ``` shell
    POST https://einwilligen.netid.de/netid-permissions?
      q.tapp_id.eq=<TAPP_ID>
    Content-Type: application/vnd.netid.permission-center.netid-permissions-v1+json
    Accept: application/vnd.netid.permission-center.netid-tpid-subject-status-v1+json
    Cookie: tpid_sec=<JWT_TOKEN>
    Origin: <ORIGIN>

    {
      "identification": "true|false",
      "tc": "<TC string>"
      "datashare": "VALID"|"INVALID" 
    }
    ```

=== "Response"

    ``` shell
    201 CREATED
    Location: https://einwilligungsspeicher.netid.de/netid-permissions?
      q.tapp_id.eq=<TAPP_ID>
    Access-Control-Allow-Origin: <ORIGIN>
    Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true

    {
      "tpid": "<TPID>|null",
      "status": "OK"|"ID_CONSENT_REQUIRED"
    }
    ```

!!! info "Remarks"
    - There must be at least one permission ("identification", "tc", "datashare"). Permissions are optional. If a permission should not be written, the JSON property is missing. 
    - If consent for "identification"/"datashare" has been given by the user, this must be signaled by passing "identification: true"/"datashare: true". For the avoidance of doubt, this of course requires the prior collection of this consent by the CMP.
    - If only the TC string is to be updated and the consent for "identification"/"datashare" already exists, only the "tc" attribute can be passed. All three can also be written at the same time.
    - In case of revocation the consent for "identification"/"datashare", "identification: false"/"datashare: false" is passed.

#### Request properties

|item|description|
|---|---|
| identification | Boolean flag, indicating the status of the consent "identification". <br> *true* = Consent is given <br> *false* = consent is not given or revoked |
| tc | TC String which should be stored/updated for this user in relation to the netID Partner (TCF 2.0) |
| datashare | Boolean flag, indicating the status of the consent "datashare". <br> *true* = Consent is given <br> *false* = consent is not given or revoked |

#### Response properties

`tpid` - Users netID Identifier. Only passed, if consent "identification" is given, the `tpid` is known and status is "OK". Otherwise null.

| status_code | meaning |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| OK | TC String/consent for "identification" was stored. |
| NO_TPID | There was no `tpid_sec` cookie available. Parameter 'name' is missing. |
