## Create a Service 

To start, log in into the [netID Developer Portal](https://developer.netid.de/login). Create a **service** for which you want to leverage the netID single sign-on. Select **Services** in the menu, 
click **Add service** and fill in the required details in the following screen.

Next to the name, which should describe your service, is the **Service domain** an important value.
The service domain is the domain of your customer facing website. 
Also, links to data policies information and terms of use should be supplied.

The Service domain will also be the prefix for the Client Callback which you need to enter in the client section. 

As a best practice please use seperate services for development and live environments. This guarantees you that the reporting covers on√∂y data for the specific case.

!!! info ""
    Note: for testing purposes, you can actually enter any domain and URL values into this form, as they are not technically relevant in order to get the netID integration in Auth0 running
 
Uploading your logo will help your future customer identify your service during the login process.   

To save your service, click on **Add service**.

For each service you can now create clients.
Please refer to the **Client Tutorial**.
